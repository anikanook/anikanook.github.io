Looks like it finally happened.  After years of stops and starts, anxiety about design and content and templates and frameworks, I've just gone ahead and put up a simple static site.  Hooray for me!  This is a big deal for me.  I'm going to pop open a bottle of Champagne (for real).

So, this site, as of writing doesn't have much in the way of design or frameworks or even content.  I don't know what this is goign to look like.  It's not even in Drupal, my bread and butter, which had been an idea too hard to swallow....

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
