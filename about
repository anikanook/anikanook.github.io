Hey there, I’m Anika. I’m a Drupal web developer living in Washington, DC. I learned to code in high school and rediscovered it after leaving my corporate communications job a couple of years ago. I studied film production at New York University, specializing in cinematography and documentary production. My best days at work remind me of film school. I love tinkering with code. There's just nothing like the feeling of getting something to work for the first time.

My life-long passion is acting. I act in independent productions in DC. My favorite plays to work on are by Shakespeare and the Greeks. I'll be doing my first puppet show in March with HalfMad Theater and the York Symphony Orchestra.
